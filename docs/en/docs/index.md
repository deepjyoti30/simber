# Simber

## Requirements

Simber tries to be a **minimal** logging library with a lot of functionality. Most of the requirements of Simber are internal except one.

Simber leverages [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama) in order to show colors in the terminal
and keep it working across platforms.
